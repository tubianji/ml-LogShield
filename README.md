# ml-LogShield

ml-LogShield is a top-notch machine learning project harnessing the power of TensorFlow.js to track and identify harmful activities in web server access and login logs. It provides an effective defense mechanism for your server, spotting and flagging suspect behaviors to help guard against possible security breaches.

Driven by a complex Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, ml-LogShield specializes in sequential data understanding, allowing it to grasp the temporal dependencies in the logs and accurately identify patterns of harmful activity
